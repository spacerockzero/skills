# Skills Program 2.0
*More exciting, principle-oriented, flexible, open, and future-friendly*

## Principle goals:
- Learn and prove valuable skills that org uses by creating interesting things
- Get excited about learning new things and being creative
- Infect others with this excitement
- Devs can prove required skills (for their rank) to the org
- Get everyone involved in learning, sharing and mentoring skills


## Additional skills backlog:
- github (required x rank)
- node (required x rank)
- performance
- security
- angular
- heroku (required x rank?)
- hackday apps (making novel micro-apps with FS API’s)
- markdown (micro)


## Program ideas

### Make skills program git-based, using a repo on github.
- (Pages, jekyll? Approachable, FS Github workflow)
- Devs learn the FS Github workflow as they help contribute to fresh, new content. This keeps devs skilled in git/github and keeps curriculum up-to-date and sustainable.

### Make skills program open-source to discipline and accepts PRs.
- Devs can contribute edits, curriculum, and badge wishlists openly through PR and issue/enhancement system

### Skills Badges may be smaller
- Some categories may only have 1 lvl
- Microbadges may take 8-16 hrs to complete?
- Can group up microbadges to earn one reward?

### Badge Curriculum structure may be more free-form and minimal
- Enables multiple options for completing
- Enables creativity in writing & achieving skill
- Possible template:
> **Suggested Study**
>> Read Ch 9 - "Templating", from "Node.js in Action" (found in Library)
> **Goal**
>> Demonstrate that you understand and are competent in templating
> **Suggested Assignments (If you can't think of your own project idea**
>> 1) Write your own templating language and show it off.
>>> Bonus: Demonstrate both your language & markdown (or some other) templating working together in the same document.
>> 2) With your newfound understanding of how templating works, figure out how we use it within Frontier. Update/Improve/Create documentation for this where appropriate within the context of Frontier.

### Have a time and location set aside for HackDay
- Organic, optional. Like a Friday afternoon in a conference room with tables
- Devs can learn and mentor each other, share creative ideas
- Have open enhancement thread in repo to list possible HackDay project ideas

### Have a time to share skill hack apps that devs have made.
- (sharing is infectious)
- Devs can inspire others with the cool things they’ve made and learned

### Be open to involving certain 3rd-party training resources
- nodeschool.io
- codecademy
- codeschool (free courses)

### Hackday example ideas
- Use Photos API to inject random monsters into random old pictures
- Use photos API to do a “Who’s cooler?” between two random people’s portraits
